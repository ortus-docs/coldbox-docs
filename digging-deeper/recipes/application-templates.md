# Application Templates

We have a Github organization called [coldbox-templates](https://github.com/coldbox-templates) that has a great collection of application startup templates. You can collaborate with the existing ones or send us new ones to add.

## CommandBox Integration

The `coldbox create app` command has integration to our application templates via the `skeleton` argument. This can be the name of each of the templates in our repositories or you can use the following alternatives:

* Name of template in our organization: `advanced,simple,super-simple,etc`
* A name of a ForgeBox entry: `cbtemplate-advanced-script,cbtemplate-simple`
* A Github shortcut: `github-username/repo`
* An HTTP/S URL to a zip file containing a template: \`[http://myapptemplates.com/template.zip](http://myapptemplates.com/template.zip)
* A folder containing a template: `/opt/shared/templates/my-template`
* A zip file containing the template: `/opt/shared/templates/my-template.zip`
