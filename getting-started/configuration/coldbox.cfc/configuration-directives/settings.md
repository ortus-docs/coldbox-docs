# Settings

These are custom application settings that you can leverage in your application.

```javascript
// Custom Settings
settings = {
    useSkins = true,
    myCoolArray = [1,2,3,4],
    skinsPath = "views/skins",
    myUtil = createObject("component","#appmapping#.model.util.MyUtility")
};
```

You can read our [Using Settings](../../using-settings.md) section to discover how to use all the settings in your application.
