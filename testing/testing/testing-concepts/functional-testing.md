# Functional Testing

[Functional testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) relies on the action of verification of specific requirements in our software. This can usually be tracked via use cases or Agile stories. "Can a user log in?", "Does the logout work", "Can I retrieve my password", "Can I purchase a book?". Our main focus of functional testing is that all these use cases need to be met.
